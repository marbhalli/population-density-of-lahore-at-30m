Any policy-level decision-making procedure and academic research involving the optimum use of resources for development and planning initiatives depends on accurate population density statistics. The current cutting-edge datasets offered by WorldPop and Meta do not succeed in achieving this aim for developing nations like Pakistan; the inputs to their algorithms provide estimations that do not accurately represent the situation on the ground. In order to precisely estimate population counts at a resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters, we use an approach that disaggregate's the most recent census data using an enhanced constructed settlement mask produced using deep segmentation networks while incorporating Points of Interests (POIs) to exclude non-residential areas.
