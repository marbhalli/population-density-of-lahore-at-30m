Reliable population density data is critical in any policy-level decision-making process and academic research involving the optimization of resources for development and planning projects. For developing countries like Pakistan, the existing state-of-the-art datasets provided by WorldPop and Meta fail to realize this goal; inputs of their algorithms result in estimates which do not reflect the true picture on the ground. We obtained this dataset from a framework that disaggregates the latest census data using an improved built settlement mask, obtained from deep segmentation networks, to accurately estimate population counts at a 30-meter by 30-meter resolution.
